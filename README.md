# ASK-NICELY
Easily create command-line applications by configuring commands, options and parameters that are supermagically parsed.

Ask Nicely is different from parsers like `minimist` because it interprets input based on what's configured, rather
than syntax alone.

## Example
An elaborate example can be found in `examples/application.annotated.js`. The following code is a functioning
command-line application (that merely dumps whatever `Request` object was parsed from input):

```js
import { Command } from 'ask-nicely';

const root = new Command();

root.addOption('alpha', 'a');

root.addCommand('subcommand', request => {
		console.log(request));
		return { somethingWasDone: true };
	})
	.addOption('beta', 'b', 'Beta is the second letter of the greek alphabet', true)
	.addParameter('gamma');

root.execute(process.argv.slice(2))
	.then(result => console.log(result))
	.catch(error => console.log(error));
```

Parsing input (`process.argv` in this example) would yield the following `Request` object in the relevant controller
and precontrollers:

```js
// node examples/application.microscopic.js -a
{
    command:    { /* the root command */ },
    options:    { alpha: true }
}

// node examples/application.microscopic.js subcommand paramValue --beta optValue
{
    command:    { /* the subcommand */ },
    parameters: { gamma: 'paramValue' },
    options:    { alpha: undefined, beta: 'optValue' }
}
```

## Advanced use
The Command methods `addOption` and `addParameter` either take a couple of strings and booleans, or an `Option` or
`Parameter` instance respectively. Creating the instance of `Option` or `Parameter` first allows you to configure it
with more advanced behaviour.

There are different kinds of `Options` and `Parameters`; for example, `--user.name wvbe` would create an object
(`req.options.user = { name: 'wvbe' }`) if you configure it as a `DeepOption`. These extending Option and Parameter
classes are exposed on `AskNicely` and it's instances.

```js
import { Option } from 'ask-nicely';

root.addOption(new Option('delta')
    .setShort('d')
    .setResolver(input => database.find('users', input))
    .addValidator(user => {
        if (user.username === 'wvbe')
            throw new Error('Get this sucka outta here');
    })
);
```

The resolver transforms flat text `input` into something different and is handled asynchronously if it returns a
`Promise`. The validator in the example would throw a custom error if the resolved `user` object happens to have my
username.

## Important classes
- Command
- Option
    - MultiOption (like `--emails one@hotmail.com two@hotmail.com`)
    - DeepOption (like `--config.username wvbe`)
    - IsolatedOption (like `--help`, prevents further input parsing)
- Parameter
    - DeepParameter (as seen in `git config`)
- Request (user input is assigned to this object)
- InputError (thrown if a mistake was made by the end-user rather than a programmer)

## Important methods
- Command, Option and Parameter classes (`NamedSyntaxPart`)
    - `constructor(name)`
    - `addAlias(alias)`
    - `setDescription(description)`
- Option and Parameter classes (`VariableSyntaxPart`)
    - `isRequired(required)`
    - `addValidator(validator)`
    - `setResolver(resolver)`
- Parameter classes
    - `setDefault(arbitrary)`
- Option classes
    - `setDefault(arbitrary, useDefaultIfFlagMissing)`
    - `setShort(short)`
- MultipleOption class
    - `isInfinite(infinite))`
- Command classes
    - `addCommand(command|name[, controller])`
    - `addOption(option|name[, short, description, required])`
    - `addParameter(parameter|name[, description, required])`
    - `addPreController(controller)`
    - `execute(input, [request, ...arbitrary])`
    - `parse(input, [request, ...arbitrary])`
    - `setController(controller)`
    - `setNewChildClass(Class)`
- Request class
    - `constructor()`
    - `execute([...arbitrary])`

## Behaviour
- Input for `Options` or `Parameters` can contain spaces if the input is wrapped in double-quotes (`--opt "My option"`)
- `Options` and `Parameters` accumulate as you go deeper from root into subcommands. In this way, any command can add
  scope to the underlying subcommands through the `Request` object
- Precontrollers (`Command#addPrecontroller()`) are accumulated as you go deeper into subcommands as well. When a
  command is ran, all of it's ancestors precontrollers are ran too. In this way, for example, a precontroller can
  determine if the execution chain should stop for a certain combination of options (by returning `false`).
- With exception of `DeepOption`, `Option` classes with a default value will stay undefined, unless you set the second
  argument of `Option#setDefault()` to `true`.
- Arbitrary arguments to `AskNicely#interpret()` and `Request#execute()` are passed down to syntax resolvers,
  precontrollers and controllers. This allows you to pass an application/config object along.

## Release notes
- v 4.0.0
  - Fixed an issue where the most specifically defined Option (ie. on the deepest command) of the same name did not win.
- v 3.0.0
  - _Deprecate the `Root` class, any `Command` can serve as root_
  - _Refactor `Root#interpret()` to `Command#parse()`, which doesn't throw and parses more_
  - _Add `Command#execute()` which parses, executes, and throws like the previous `interpret` method would have._
- v 2.0.0
  - Expose classes as an ES6 module
  - Package using rollup and babel ES2015 preset
  - _Rename the AskNicely (root class) to Root_
  - _Do not expose the root class as a default export_
  - _Do not expose classes via an instance of ask-nicely_
- v 1.1.1
  - Fix the way InputError was exposed
- v1.1.0
  - Adding `Command#addAlias(alias)`
  - Throwing new `InputError` as opposed to regular `Error` in some cases, allows you do distinguish user errors from
    system errors.
  - Exposing `Request` and allow to use pass own instance to `AskNicely#interpret()`
  - Adding `Command#setController(controller)` and `#setNewChildClass(Class)`
  - Declaring properties on Request in constructor so you don't have to keep null-checking
  - Adding `MultiOption` class, which evaluates to an array
- v1.0.0
  - Using ECMAScript 6
  - `Option`, `Parameter` and related classes increase configurability a thousandfold
  - Moved most parsing logic to individual classes that represent a syntax part
  - `AskNicely#interpret()` is no longer synchronous because of the ability to asynchronously resolve values
  - Ditching a lot of useless methods that are not directly used for parsing or configuring, moving a lot of other
    stuff
  - Ditching `Command#isHungry()` and `Command#isGreedy()`
- v0.1.0
  - Initial release, pretty basic parsing with limited configurability

## Issues/known bugs
- There's a problem in `VariableSyntaxPart` that would fail to clone the `default` property object of a `DeepOption` of
  `DeepParameter`, resulting in changes to the `default` value that is shared with other instances of that syntax part.
  As a work-around the `default` object is stringified and parsed again, therefore it is limited to something that can
  be serialized.
- Your terminal may replace patterns (like "*") with an actual list of matching file names before the node process is
  even started. This prevents parsing those patterns in AskNicely, and may yield unexpected results. Seen in
  `gnome-terminal` using `oh-my-zsh`. Can be circumvented by enclosing input data in double quotes, although that's
  kind of shitty.

## Wishlist
- Fix aforementioned issues and known bugs.
- `DeepOption` with a default value should stay undefined if flag is not set, like rest of `Option` classes.
- Implement `isInfinite()` for other `VariableSyntaxPart` classes
- Implement `addAlias()` for all `NamedSyntaxPart` classes, maybe.
- A different way of stopping the controller chain, returning FALSE is a little crude
- Make it easy for commands to call other commands, maybe in a dependency-aware manner
- Test more edge cases, like conflicts and multiple values
